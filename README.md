# smartheart-ai-multimodal-risk-fusion
An intelligent multimodal cardiovascular risk detection system that fuses clinical and lifestyle parameters using machine learning for early disease prediction.
SmartHeart AI is an intelligent machine learning framework designed for early cardiovascular disease detection by fusing heterogeneous health indicators. The system integrates clinical biomarkers and lifestyle parameters into a unified predictive model, enabling risk stratification through multimodal data fusion.
Unlike traditional single-feature medical screening tools, SmartHeart AI applies ensemble learning techniques to capture complex interactions between physiological and behavioral risk factors. This hybrid modeling approach improves interpretability, prediction robustness, and practical applicability in preventive healthcare scenarios.

Key capabilities include:
1) Multimodal risk fusion modeling
2) Clinical + lifestyle parameter integration
3) Ensemble machine learning prediction
4) API-based inference pipeline
5) Reproducible training workflow
6) Scalable deployment architecture

This project demonstrates applied AI in healthcare analytics, emphasizing ethical data handling, interpretability, and preventive decision support.
